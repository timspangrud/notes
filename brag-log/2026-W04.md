Brag Log
Week of 2026-01-25

Learned (new concepts that stuck)
- Boot-time race conditions can result from incorrect systemd service ordering or missing dependencies, and require comparing logs across multiple reboots to diagnose reliably.
- Windows boot failures in dual-boot environments are often recoverable by rebuilding the Windows boot record and restoring the bootloader rather than reinstalling the OS.
- Printer instability is frequently caused poor network routing resolution. Diagnosed caused, and installed appropriate package in Kubuntu.

Friction (what slowed me down)
- The intermittent nature of the boot issue made it difficult to reproduce consistently.
- Dual-boot recovery required careful sequencing to avoid overwriting the Linux bootloader while repairing Windows.
- Printer symptoms were misleading at first because failures appeared sporadic rather than configuration-based.

Next week (2–3 targets)
- Harden SSH access and validate key-only authentication using log inspection.
- Replace the default nginx configuration with an explicit site config and per-site logging.
- Begin structured log review to identify normal versus anomalous access patterns.
