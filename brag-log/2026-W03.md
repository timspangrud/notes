# Brag Log — Week of Jan 8-14

## Infrastructure & Linux
- Hardened OpenSSH configuration using key-only authentication, user allow-listing, and disabled root SSH access.
- Reconfigured SSH to listen on a non-standard port (2222) while safely maintaining access during testing.
- Diagnosed a mismatch between effective SSH configuration (`sshd -T`) and active listeners by identifying systemd socket activation (`ssh.socket`) as the controlling mechanism.

## Web & Networking
- Implemented and tested dual approaches to SSH port management:
  - systemd socket override to enable dual-port listening
  - disabling socket activation to return port control to `sshd_config`
- Verified runtime behavior and port bindings using `ss` and client-side connectivity testing.

## Security & Observability
- Monitored SSH service behavior and access attempts using `journalctl`.
- Identified and resolved a UFW firewall misconfiguration that silently blocked the new SSH port.
- Confirmed successful end-to-end connectivity and enforced access controls on port 2222 after updating firewall rules.

## Professional Growth
- Demonstrated layered troubleshooting across daemon configuration, systemd service models, and firewall policy.
- Practiced production-safe change management: syntax validation, non-disruptive reloads, and multi-signal verification.

## Key Takeaway
Effective configuration does not guarantee reachability — validating runtime state and firewall policy is essential to confirm real-world access.

## Next Week
- Extend UFW rules to restrict SSH access to LAN or VPN-only sources.
- Add rate limiting or intrusion prevention (e.g., Fail2ban) and validate behavior through log analysis.
