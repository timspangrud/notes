# Brag Log — Week of Jan 6–12, 2026

## Infrastructure & Linux
- Provisioned a Google Cloud Compute Engine Linux VM from scratch using least-cost settings and regional consistency.
- Installed and verified nginx on Ubuntu, resolving initial `apt` lock contention caused by unattended background updates.
- Confirmed service health locally using `curl` and systemd status checks.
- Resolved network configuration error in 'cups' to properly route traffic

## Web & Networking
- Validated HTTP request/response behavior using `curl -I` (HEAD requests) to inspect headers without payloads.
- Distinguished between localhost traffic and external traffic by comparing access logs.
- Confirmed correct firewall behavior and external IP accessibility.
- Finished installation of SSH keys and SSH access on home lab VM.

## Security & Observability
- Actively monitored live nginx access logs using `tail -f`.
- Identified and correctly classified automated internet scanning activity targeting known JBoss/JMX endpoints.
- Interpreted request methods, paths, status codes, and user-agent strings to distinguish benign testing from opportunistic probing.
- Verified that the VM was not vulnerable (404 responses, no exposed management endpoints).

## Professional Growth
- Demonstrated real-world cloud + Linux + security workflow: provisioning → service deployment → verification → log analysis → threat interpretation.
- Practiced production-relevant habits: minimal exposure, observability first, and evidence-based conclusions.

## Key Takeaway
Even a minimal public cloud VM receives automated reconnaissance within minutes.
Security is not hypothetical — it is observable, measurable, and constant.

## Next Week
- Finalize SSH hardening and validate access attempts via logs to ensure key-only authentication is enforced.
- Harden nginx configuration and analyze real inbound traffic patterns using access and error logs.
